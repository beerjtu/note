## Concepts
* incident light: 入射光
* light sensor is a rectangular piece of silicon that has a grid of light detectors (a single pixel in picture) on it.
Aperture
* Capture Time:  Between the sensor and the aperture is a shutter.  The shorter this period of time, the less chance the image will be blurred, as the less relative motion the scene or camera will have. If the shutter is opened and closed very quickly, the aperture is very small and the scene is not well lit, then each pixel will only be exposed to a small amount of light and the resulting picture may be under exposed.
* Exposure: The more light that the pixel is exposed to, the brighter the pixel will be in the resulting picture. Exposure is usually described in stops, which is a relative measure where one stop describes a doubling or halving of light. Increasing the exposure by one stop is achieved by doubling the amount of light on the sensor.

## How can exposure be changed?
1. Shutter speed: a faster (shorter) shutter speed (a sharper picture)will decrease the exposure.
2. ISO: Pixel amplification, increase the light detector sensitivity. Increasing ISO will increase exposure, but will also make the noise in the image more noticeable resulting in grainy pictures. 
3. Aperture: Another way to increase exposure is to increase the aperture.
    * f-numbers (f-stops): f/N, which describes the diameter of the lens. 
    * N is the ratio of the lens focal length(f) to aperture diameter(D): N = f/D
    * To double the amount of light, the aperture area must be doubled.
    * As the aperture is a circle, doubling the aperture area increases the diameter by a factor of 1.414 (square root of 2)
    * The difference in focus between features at different distances from the camera is known as Depth of Field(景深)

* Wild/Narrow Field of View and Focal Length
* Blur/Sharp image and Shutter Speed
* Low/High Noise and ISO
* Deep/Shallow Depth of Field and Aperture
