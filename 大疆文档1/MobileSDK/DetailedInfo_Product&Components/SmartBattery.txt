1.estimate remaining flight time 2.provide warning when low battery thresholds are crossed

Battery Parameters:
1.the amount of energy it can store when fully charged.
2.the amount of energy it currently has remaining.

Instantaneous Parameters:
remaing energy, voltage, and predicted remaining flight time.

Lifetime Parameters:
total number of cycles, full charge energy, and remaining life time(when to replace battery)

Battery Aggregation:
A multi-battery system is strong as its weakest link. Therefore for most efficiency, it's important to make sure all batteries in the system are performing similiarly.
